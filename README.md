# faceDetector
The project(faceDetector.py) is a face detection system implemented in Python using OpenCV and PIL (Python Imaging Library). It aims to detect faces in images and resize the image to fit the maximum size of the user's monitor. The system first loads an original image using OpenCV, then resizes it using PIL to maintain the aspect ratio and fit within the screen dimensions. The resized image is then passed to a face detection algorithm to detect faces in the image. Detected faces are marked with rectangles using OpenCV's rectangle function. Finally, the resized image with the detected face rectangles is saved as a new image. The project utilizes the screen size, aspect ratio, image processing, and face detection techniques to resize and annotate images with detected faces for display on the user's monitor.

the project(faceDetectorUsingCamerapy) uses the OpenCV library to perform real-time face detection from the video stream of a camera. It starts by capturing video frames from the default camera (camera index 0) using cv2.VideoCapture() function. It then uses a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for frontal face detection, which is loaded from the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file. The frames are converted to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor() function for faster processing. The trainedFaceData.detectMultiScale() function is used to detect faces in the grayscale frames, which returns the coordinates of the detected faces as rectangles. These rectangles are drawn on the original frames using cv2.rectangle() function with green color (BGR value of (0, 255, 0)) and thickness of 2 pixels. The processed frames with detected faces are displayed in a window titled 'Face detector' using cv2.imshow() function. The loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key to exit.
